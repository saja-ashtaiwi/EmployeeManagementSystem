# EmployeeManagementSystem
My recently developed Employee Management System. This system is constructed using .NET and C# programming languages, with essential functionalities supported by SQL for database management. Additionally, Bootstrap has been utilized to enhance the user interface and user experience design.

The core of this project is the robust handling of employee data, enabling functionalities such as adding, editing, updating, and deleting employee records, which are essential for any companyâ€™s HR operations. The system architecture includes both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between entities, facilitating a comprehensive and interconnected data management approach.

While the system is currently operational and functions effectively for its primary purposes, there are some imperfections that we are aware of. These do not hinder the overall performance but are areas we aim to improve in future updates to enhance system reliability and user experience.
